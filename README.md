# the shoppin webapp

### mission
to make a webapp with pages that are each a simple app to help with shopping.

What this will not be is a list app, there are way to many of those and I use Apple Notes for that already.

### ideas as of now
- **tally**: add the price of the item your throwing into the cart. It will tell you the tally so far and you can see a list of prices to remove ones if you remove from cart.
- **comp**: compare the price per unit of two items. You enter the price and quantity of each and it tells you the price/each and which is cheaper
- **don't know yet*: ....
